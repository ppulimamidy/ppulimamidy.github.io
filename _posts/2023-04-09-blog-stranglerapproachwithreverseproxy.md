## Modernizing Legacy Applications with Reverse Proxying: A Strangler Approach

In recent years, many organizations have been moving towards modernizing their legacy applications. Application modernization involves updating and improving the architecture, technology, and functionality of an existing application. One approach to application modernization is the strangler pattern, which involves gradually replacing the old application with a new one. One way to implement the strangler pattern is by using reverse proxying.

Reverse proxying involves using a server to receive requests from clients and forward them to a backend server. Reverse proxying can be used as a part of a strangler approach to gradually replace an old application with a new one. In this article, we will discuss how to use reverse proxying for application modernization.

### Set up a reverse proxy server: 
The first step in using reverse proxying for application modernization is to set up a reverse proxy server. The reverse proxy server will receive requests from clients and forward them to the backend server. The reverse proxy server can be set up using various software such as Nginx, Apache, or HAProxy.

### Identify the legacy application's endpoints: 
The next step is to identify the endpoints of the legacy application. The endpoints are the URLs that the legacy application uses to serve requests. Once the endpoints are identified, the reverse proxy server can be configured to forward requests to the appropriate endpoint of the legacy application.

### Identify the new application's endpoints: 
The third step is to identify the endpoints of the new application. The endpoints are the URLs that the new application uses to serve requests. Once the endpoints are identified, the reverse proxy server can be configured to forward requests to the appropriate endpoint of the new application.

### Gradually replace the legacy application: 
The final step is to gradually replace the legacy application with the new one. This can be done by gradually changing the configuration of the reverse proxy server to forward requests to the new application's endpoints instead of the legacy application's endpoints. This approach ensures that the new application is tested and validated before it is fully rolled out.

Using reverse proxying for application modernization has many benefits. It allows for gradual replacement of the legacy application, reducing the risk of downtime and data loss. It also enables developers to test and validate the new application before it is fully rolled out, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the business.

In conclusion, reverse proxying is a useful technique for implementing the strangler pattern in application modernization. By setting up a reverse proxy server, identifying the legacy and new application's endpoints, and gradually replacing the legacy application, organizations can modernize their applications safely and efficiently. Reverse proxying is an effective way to modernize legacy applications and future-proof them for the needs of the business.
