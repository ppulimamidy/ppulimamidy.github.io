## WebAssembly with Rust Example


Using WebAssembly (Wasm) with Rust is a popular choice for developing high-performance web applications. Rust is a statically-typed, low-level programming language that is designed to be fast, secure, and efficient. When combined with WebAssembly, Rust can be used to create powerful and efficient web applications that run directly in the browser. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Wasm and Rust:

Install Rust: The first step is to install the Rust programming language on your computer. You can download Rust from the official website (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the installation instructions.

Create a Rust project: Next, create a new Rust project using the following command:

cargo new project_name
This will create a new Rust project with the specified name and a basic structure.

Add the wasm-bindgen dependency: To use Wasm with Rust, you need to add the wasm-bindgen library to your project. You can add this dependency by adding the following line to your Cargo.toml file:

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"

Write Rust code: Next, write the Rust code that you want to use in your Wasm application. For example, you could write a simple Rust function that adds two numbers together:
rust

use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]

pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

Compile to Wasm: To compile your Rust code to Wasm, you need to run the following command:

wasm-pack build

This command will compile your Rust code to Wasm and generate a .wasm file that you can use in your web application.

Integrate with your web application: Finally, you need to integrate your Wasm code with your web application. You can do this by loading the .wasm file in your JavaScript code and calling the Rust functions from JavaScript. 

For example:

const wasm = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("path/to/your/wasm.wasm"));
const add = wasm.instance.exports.add;
console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3
This is a basic example of how to use Wasm and Rust together. With these tools, you can create powerful and efficient web applications that run directly in the browser.
