## What is Platform Thinking ?

Platform thinking is a way of understanding the world and business that focuses on creating networks of users and producers that can interact and create value for each other. It is based on the idea that the most successful businesses in the modern economy are those that create platforms – networks of users and producers – that allow others to interact and create value for each other.

One of the key aspects of platform thinking is the recognition that in today's economy, the most valuable businesses are not those that produce goods or services, but those that create networks of users and producers that can interact and create value for each other. This is because networks have the potential to create value that is much greater than the sum of the individual parts.

For example, consider the impact of social media networks like Facebook and Twitter. These networks have created huge value for their users by allowing them to connect with each other and share information and ideas. In turn, this has created value for the companies that operate these networks, as they are able to monetize the interactions and connections between their users.

Another key aspect of platform thinking is the idea that platforms are not just limited to technology companies. Any business that creates a network of users and producers can be considered a platform. For example, a grocery store can be seen as a platform that connects producers of food with consumers. By creating this platform, the grocery store is able to create value for both producers and consumers, and in turn, generate value for itself.

Platform thinking also emphasizes the importance of focusing on user needs and creating value for users. This is because the success of a platform depends on the number and engagement of its users. By creating a platform that is valuable to users, a business can attract more users and create a virtuous cycle of growth and value creation.

In conclusion, platform thinking is a powerful way of understanding the modern economy and business. By recognizing the value of networks and focusing on user needs, businesses can create platforms that generate value for both themselves and their users.
