##When to Use Linear Regression in AI/ML: Understanding its Assumptions and Limitations

Linear regression is a simple but powerful machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. It is a supervised learning algorithm, meaning that it requires a labeled dataset to be trained on, and it is also commonly used as a first step in building more complex models. In this blog, we'll discuss when linear regression should be used in AI/ML.

Simple relationship between independent and dependent variables: Linear regression is best used when there is a simple linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. If the relationship is non-linear or has multiple variables influencing the outcome, other algorithms such as decision trees or random forests may be more appropriate.

Predicting continuous outcomes: Linear regression is best suited for predicting continuous outcomes, such as the price of a house or the weight of a person. It is not suitable for predicting categorical outcomes, such as the color of a flower or whether a person is diabetic.

Limited number of predictors: Linear regression is best used when there are a limited number of predictors, as adding too many predictors can lead to overfitting and decreased model accuracy.

Normal distribution of the error term: Linear regression assumes that the error term (the difference between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome) is normally distributed. If the error term is not normally distributed, other models such as logistic regression or Poisson regression may be more appropriate.

Large sample size: Linear regression requires a large sample size to ensure that the model is representative of the population. If the sample size is too small, the model may be unreliable and may not generalize well to new data.

In conclusion, linear regression is a versatile and widely used machine learning algorithm that is well suited for simple, continuous outcome prediction problems with a limited number of predictors. However, it is important to consider the assumptions and limitations of linear regression before applying it to your data. If the assumptions are not met, it may be necessary to consider alternative algorithms.
