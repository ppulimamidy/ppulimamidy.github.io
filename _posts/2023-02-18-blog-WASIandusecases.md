## WASI: The Bridge Between WebAssembly and Operating Systems

WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a system interface designed to run WebAssembly modules outside of a web browser, enabling developers to build portable, secure, and sandboxed applications. In this article, we'll dive into the details of what WASI is, its benefits, and its use cases.

What is WASI?

WASI is a system interface that allows WebAssembly to interact with the host operating system. It provides a standardized API for low-level operations like file I/O, network access, and process management. By doing so, it enables WebAssembly modules to run on any platform that supports WASI, without having to worry about the underlying OS.

In essence, WASI is a bridge between WebAssembly modules and the host operating system, allowing developers to create portable and secure applications.

Benefits of WASI

One of the main benefits of WASI is its portability. Developers can write code once and run it on any platform that supports WASI, which greatly simplifies the development process. This also makes it easier to distribute applications since there's no need to build different binaries for different platforms.

WASI also provides a sandboxed environment for running WebAssembly modules. This means that the modules are isolated from the host operating system, and can only access resources that are explicitly granted to them. This greatly enhances the security of the system since it prevents malicious code from accessing sensitive data or executing arbitrary code.

Additionally, WASI has a small and well-defined API, making it easier to implement and test than other system interfaces. This reduces the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities in the system, which is crucial for systems that require high levels of security.

Use Cases for WASI

WASI has a wide range of use cases, ranging from running WebAssembly modules in serverless environments to building desktop applications. Here are a few examples:

Serverless Functions: WASI can be used to run serverless functions in a portable and secure environment. This enables developers to write functions in any language that can compile to WebAssembly and run them in a variety of cloud environments.

Desktop Applications: WASI can be used to build desktop applications in WebAssembly, allowing for a seamless user experience across different platforms. This can be especially useful for applications that require high levels of security, such as financial or medical applications.

Web Browsers: While WASI is designed to run outside of a web browser, it can also be used within the browser. This can provide additional security and isolation for running third-party code, such as plugins or extensions.

Conclusion

WASI is a powerful system interface that enables developers to write portable and secure applications in WebAssembly. Its small and well-defined API makes it easier to implement and test, while its sandboxed environment enhances the security of the system. As more platforms add support for WASI, we can expect to see a growing number of applications that leverage its benefits.
